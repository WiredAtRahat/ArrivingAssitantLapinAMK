Managing your finances effectively is essential for students. Here are practical tips on budgeting, finding part-time work, and accessing student discounts, along with specific resources available through the university and useful apps.

## Budgeting Tips

   Outline your expected income and expenses for the month, including tuition fees, rent, groceries, and leisure activities. Use budgeting apps or spreadsheets to track your spending.
