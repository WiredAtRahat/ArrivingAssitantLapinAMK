## Finnish Police Identification Cards

### Foreigner's Identity Card

If you are a foreign citizen residing in Finland permanently, you can apply for a foreigner's identity card from the police. Requirements include:

- Details entered in the Population Information System
- Valid residence permit or residence card
- Reliable verification of identity

The card is valid for five years. For more information, visit the [Suomi.fi website](https://www.suomi.fi/services/foreigners-identity-card-poliisi/784cf477-b2b0-4799-8e86-c07a2b7d65b1).

### Identity Verification Certificate

If you are in Finland for less than a year, you can apply for an identity verification certificate (*todistus ensitunnistuksesta*) from the police. This allows you to receive strong identification codes faster than the Finnish ID card process. 

To apply, visit your local bank to complete the application, then visit the police station with the prefilled application and two passport photos. The certificate will be sent directly to your bank for processing the identification codes.

For detailed instructions, see the [Police website](https://poliisi.fi/en/instructions-for-applying-for-identification-for-the-purpose-of-electronic-identification-documents).
